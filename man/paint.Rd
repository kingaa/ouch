\title{Painting regimes on a phylogenetic tree}
\usage{
paint(tree, subtree, branch, which = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An object of class \code{ouchtree}.}

\item{subtree}{An optional named vector specifying the root nodes of subtrees.
Each branch that descends from this node will be painted with the
specified regime.}

\item{branch}{An optional named vector specifying the end nodes of branches.
The unique branch that terminates at the named node will be painted with the specified regime.}

\item{which}{integer;
if \code{tree} is a \code{hansentree}, start not with a blank canvas but with the regime specifications \code{tree} contains for the character indicated by \code{which}.}
}
\value{
A vector of class \sQuote{factor} with names corresponding to the nodes in \code{tree}, specifying selective regimes.
}
\description{
Function to paint selective regimes on a phylogenetic tree.
}
\details{
The names of \code{subtree} and \code{branch} must be the names of nodes of \code{tree}.
The painting proceeds in a particular order:
one can overpaint a branch.
The subtrees indicated by the elements of \code{subtree} are painted first, in order.
Then the branches indicated by \code{branch} are painted.
If \code{tree} is a simple \code{ouchtree} object, then \code{paint} begins with a blank canvas,
i.e., a tree painted with the single regime \dQuote{nonspec}.
If \code{tree} is of class \code{hansentree}, then \code{paint} begins with the regimes specified in the \code{regimes} slot of \code{tree}.
Note that, if \code{tree} is a multivariate \code{hansentree}, then there are multiple regime specifications contained in \code{tree}.
In this case, the argument \code{which} lets you pick which one you wish to begin with;
by default, the first is used.

\examples{
x <- with(
  bimac,
  ouchtree(nodes=node,times=time/max(time),ancestors=ancestor,labels=species)
)

r <- paint(x,subtree=c("1"="medium","9"="large","2"="small"),
  branch=c("38"="large","2"="medium"))
plot(x,regimes=r,node.names=TRUE)

## compare to bimac['OU.LP']
h5 <- hansen(data=log(bimac['size']),tree=x,regimes=bimac['OU.LP'],
  sqrt.alpha=1,sigma=1,reltol=1e-5)
r <- paint(h5,branch=c("18"="large"),subtree=c("9"="small"))
plot(x,regimes=r,node.names=TRUE)
