<h2>News for Package 'ouch'</h2>

<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.16-6</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> There is now an example showing how to plot a tree with long taxon names.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.16-3</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Error messages and examples have been improved somewhat.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.16-2</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> The manual and help pages have been streamlined.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.16-1</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> The arguments to the various <code>plot</code> methods have changed.
There is now much finer control over the plotting.
In particular, one can specify a different palette of colors, adjust the width of the margin in which taxon labels are printed, and pass options separately to the base-graphics <code>plot</code>, <code>text</code>, and <code>legend</code> commands under0lying the <span class="pkg">ouch</span> <code>plot</code> methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> A layout bug in <code>plot</code> has been fixed.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.15</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> The <code>plot</code> function now spaces the terminal taxa evenly.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The documentation has received an overhaul.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.14</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Depends on R&gt;=3.6.
This change necessitated by modifications to the default RNG with R version 3.6.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.13</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Changes to the organization of the package.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.12</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Upgrade the package license to GPL version 3.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.11</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Improvements to the underlying C code, which now registers callable functions.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.10</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> In <code>glssoln</code>, when the Choleski decomposition fails, a warning is issued and <code>NA</code>s are returned.
In previous versions, an error was thrown.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.8</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> 'as(tree,&quot;data.frame&quot;)' now returns a data-frame with rownames identical to the node-names (tree@nodes).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Functions that have been deprecated since 2.1-1 have been removed.
The argument 'alpha' that was deprecated in favor of 'sqrt.alpha' in version 2.6-1 has been removed.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.7</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Fixed typo in the documentation of 'hansen'.  Thanks to Roland Sookias for bringing this to my attention.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.6</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> In the 'hansen' function, the use of the argument 'alpha' was confusing.  
This vector parameterizes the &quot;selection&quot; portion of the OU model, which since version 2 has been assumed to be a positive-definite matrix (corresponding to stabilizing selection).
In particular, it contains the entries of the lower-triangular matrix square root of this positive definite matrix.
To make the name more mnemonic, this argument has been renamed 'sqrt.alpha'.
This is a superficial change meant to improve intelligibility: the algorithm itself has not changed.
To prevent loss of backward compatibility, use of argument 'alpha' will continue to work, though it will generate a warning.
In some future release, use of 'alpha' as an argument to 'hansen' will no longer generate a warning but will instead be passed through to the control list for 'optim' if method='optim' and will otherwise generate an error.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Changes in ouch version 2.1</h3>


<ul>
<li><p> Version 2 of ouch represents a major revision.  
ouch's capabilities have been substantially extended.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> support is now provided for multivariate characters.  
Inference based on multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and multivariate Brownian motion models is now provided.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> nonultrametric trees are supported.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the root character state need no longer be estimated.  
Instead, the root state is assumed to be distributed according to the stationary distribution of the OU process.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> convenience functions for parametric bootstrap confidence intervals are provided.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the new function 'paint' simplifies the specification of adaptive regimes in complex phylogenies.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> the new function 'ape2ouch' translates trees in the 'phylo' format of the ape package into 'ouchtree' format (thanks to Dan Ackerly).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The new package is a complete rewrite, using S4 classes.  
The old functionality from ouch v. 1 remains available, but is now deprecated.
</p>
</li></ul>
